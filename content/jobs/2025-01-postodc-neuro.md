We are investigating the short-scale dynamics of learning. During a learning session, some forms of learning emerge during practice while others consolidate during brief rest periods. Your mission will be to **model**, **analyze**, and **interpret** these dynamics using MEG/EEG and behavioral data, in collaboration with our Lyon partners.

## Responsibilities

- Design and run behavioral/MEG paradigms probing practice vs. rest learning.
- Develop analysis pipelines (Python, MNE, scikit‑learn, PyTorch welcome).
- Build computational models of learning and validate them on neural data.
- Collaborate with clinicians for translational aspects of the project.
- Write papers, present results, and contribute to open-source code.

## Requirements

- PhD (or soon) in Neuroscience, Applied Math, CS, Physics, or related field.
- Strong quantitative skills and hands-on experience with MEG/EEG or similar.
- Solid Python stack (NumPy/SciPy/pandas; MNE appreciated).
- Familiarity with ML/statistics for time‑series; Bayesian mindset a plus.
- Excellent communication; team player; fluent in English.

## What we offer

- Collaborative environment across Paris & Lyon with access to state‑of‑the‑art MEG/EEG.
- Mentoring and opportunities to supervise students.
- Funding for conferences, computing, and open science.
- Flexible start date (**from September 2025**).

I have been awarded the ATIP-Avenir grant. The goal of this project is to investigate the neural mechanisms of learning from errors and identity neural targets to modulate such learning. If you are a post-doc or a PhD candidate close to defend and passionate about computational neuroscience and machine learning, please consider to apply to our post-doc position.

We are investigating the behavioral short-scale dynamics of learning.
During a learning session, some types of learning are evidenced during short rest periods and others during the practice itself.

For example, statistical learning occurs during the practice itself while more complex rule learning occurs during short breaks. Knowing **when** the brain learns is crucial both for understanding memory formation and for developing new neurorehabilitation strategies.

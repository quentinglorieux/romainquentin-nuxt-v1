We are investigating the behavioral short-scale dynamics of learning. During a learning session, some types of learning are evidenced during short rest periods and others during the practice itself. For example, statistical learning occurs during the practice itself while more complex rule learning occurs during short-breaks. Knowing when the brain learns is crucial for both the comprehension of memory formation and consolidation and for developing new training and neurorehabilitation strategies in healthy and patient populations.

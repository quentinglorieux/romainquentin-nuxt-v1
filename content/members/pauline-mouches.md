I am a postdoctoral researcher in the MEL group. I obtained my PhD in Biomedical engineering, at the University of Calgary, Canada, in 2022. My research focuses on using image processing and machine learning/deep learning techniques to develop predictive algorithms and tools for the analysis of medical data. Within the MEL group, I am working on MEG data from patients affected with epilepsy. My aim is to develop an algorithm for interictal epileptiform discharges (spikes) detection in MEG data, using deep learning methods , with the end goal of developing an automatic tool for localization of the epileptogenic zone detection.

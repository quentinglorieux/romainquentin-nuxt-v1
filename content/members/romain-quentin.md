My research aims at identifying neural computations crucial for learning in large-scale neural dynamics and at designing innovative ways to modulate and improve learning abilities. I am mainly using machine-learning techniques applied to magnetoencephalography (MEG) and psychophysics. I have also experience on brain stimulation and diffusion imaging.

My name is Dmitrii Todorov, I am a scientist using mathematics and computer science to understand how the brain works. In other words, I work in the field of computational neuroscience. Earlier I have also worked in pure mathematics research, notably dynamical systems (chaos and ergodic theory). I am passionate about working with dynamical phenomena on all levels. From very abstract pure math analysis to very down-to-earth code implementation and transnational applications in medicine.
